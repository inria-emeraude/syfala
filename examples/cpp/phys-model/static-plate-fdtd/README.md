# FDPlate README

The folder contains several versions of the time domain finite difference plate reverberation simulation.
A `Makefile` allows to compile and launch the different implementations.

## Setup
In the `Makefile`, change the `SYFALA_DIR` and `VITIS_HLS_INCUDE_DIR` to the location of the root of syfala and the includes of Vitis HLS. Also change the `VITIS_VERSION` to the version you are using.

## FDPlate_Cpp_Craig_Webb
Contains code made by Craig Webb at the University of Edinburgh. All the other implementations are based of this one

## FDPlate.jl
Julia implementation of the base algorithm


## HLS implementations 

There are two main different implementations of the algorithm:
- A basic one, following the base algorithm
- A partitioned one, splitting the state matrices in subparts for more efficient memory acces and reduced latency

The two types of algorithms have a monosample and a multisample versions. 

### constants.h, grid_config.h
These files a respectivly generated by `constants.jl` and `grid_config.jl` that precompute the constants and the partioning of the grid for the HLS implementations. 

### CSIM

The `Makefile` has targets to


### Standalone compilation 
The `Makefile` has targets for compiling the hls and csim programs with gcc to allow a more convenient step debugging workflow in GDB.
